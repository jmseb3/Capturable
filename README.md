## üí°Introduction 

In the previous View system, drawing Bitmap Image from `View` was very straightforward. But that's not the case with Jetpack Compose since it's different in many aspects from previous system. This library helps easy way to achieve the same results.

## üöÄ Implementation

You can check [/composeApp](/composeApp) directory which includes example application for demonstration.

<summary>How To Test sample?</summary>

### Android
To run the application on android device/emulator:  
 - open project in Android Studio and run imported android run configuration

### Desktop
Run the desktop application: `./gradlew :composeApp:run`

### iOS
To run the application on iPhone device/simulator:
- Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcproject` in Xcode and run standard configuration

### JS Browser
Run the browser application: `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun --continue`

### Wasm Browser
Run the browser application: `./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun --continue`
</details>

### Gradle setup

In `lib.versions.toml`  include this dependency version catalog

```toml
[versions]
capturable = "1.0.0"

[libraries]
capturable = { module = "io.github.jmseb3:capturable", version.ref= "capturable" }
```

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(libs.capturable)
}
```

or In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.jmseb3:capturable:1.0.0")
}
```

_You can find latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/jmseb3/Capturable/releases)_.

### Usage

#### 1. Setup the controller

To be able to capture Composable content, you need instance of [`CaptureController`](./docs/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/index.html) by which you can decide when to capture the content. You can get the instance as follow.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()
}
```

_[`rememberCaptureController()`](./docs/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/remember-capture-controller.html) is a Composable function._

#### 2. Add the content

The component which needs to be captured, a `capturable()` Modifier should be applied on that @Composable component as follows.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()

    // Composable content to be captured.
    // Here, everything inside below Column will be get captured
    Column(modifier = Modifier.capturable(captureController)) {
        MovieTicketContent(...)
    }
}
```

#### 3. Capture the content

To capture the content, use [`CaptureController#captureAsync()`](./docs/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/capture-async.html) as follows. 

```kotlin
// Example: Capture the content when button is clicked
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
Button(onClick = {
    // Capture content
    scope.launch {
        val bitmapAsync = captureController.captureAsync()
        try {
            val bitmap = bitmapAsync.await()
            // Do something with `bitmap`.
        } catch (error: Throwable) {
            // Error occurred, do something.
        }
    }
}) { ... }
```

On calling this method, request for capturing the content will be sent and `ImageBitmap` will be 
returned asynchronously. _This method is safe to be called from Main thread._
